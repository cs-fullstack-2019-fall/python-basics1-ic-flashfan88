# Start with a main function and make each problem a function.
# Call those functions from your main function.

# Problem 1:
# Create a function that asks for a student's name.
# Then ask for another student's name. Print [first student] and [second student] went to class.

userInput = input("what is your name?")
userInput2 = input("what is your name also?")

print(userInput + " and " + userInput2 + " went to class")

# Problem 2:
# Create a function to ask the user for a grade.
# Then ask the user how much extra credit they earned. Print the grade plus extra credit.


# Problem 3:
# Create a function to ask the user for three numbers. 
# Print the sum as it would be written in



# Problem 4:
# Create a function to ask the user for a number. 
# If the number is negative print "Negative!". 
# If the number is positive, print "Positive!. Otherwise print the only other number it can be.
